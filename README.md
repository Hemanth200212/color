## üß† Methodology

- **Data Collection:** Diverse images/videos from different domains and lighting environments.
- **Preprocessing:** Image cleanup, standardization, and noise reduction.
- **Feature Extraction:** Techniques such as color histograms, color moments, and spatial distributions.
- **Modeling:**
  - *Supervised Learning:* SVM, Random Forests, CNNs
  - *Unsupervised Learning:* K-Means, DBSCAN
- **Evaluation:** Metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Optimization:** Model tuning for performance.
- **Integration:** Delivered as a user-friendly app/API.
- **Validation:** Tested on real-world datasets and scenarios.
